The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon issue related to the specificity of CSS selectors and how the browser handles inheritance:

```css
.parent {
  color: blue;
}

.child {
  color: red;
}

.parent .child {
  color: green; /* This style should override the others */
}

<div class="parent">
  <span class="child"></span>
</div>
```

The expectation is that the inner span (`.child`) will be green because the most specific selector (`.parent .child`) sets the `color` to green. However, sometimes, due to how browsers handle inheritance or unexpected selector interactions, the span might unexpectedly render in red or blue.
