# CSS Specificity Bug: Unexpected Inheritance

This repository demonstrates an uncommon issue related to CSS specificity and inheritance.  The bug involves unexpected behavior in how the browser handles cascading styles in nested selectors. In certain scenarios, the expected style may not be applied, leading to unexpected visual outcomes.  The solution file shows a fix, addressing the inheritance conflict and ensuring the intended style is applied.

## Bug Description
The bug showcases an instance where the most specific CSS selector does not take precedence as expected. The expected behavior should involve the nested element inheriting the most specific style, but an unexpected inheritance or cascade conflict may cause the inheritance behavior to not work as intended.
